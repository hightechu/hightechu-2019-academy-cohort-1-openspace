### Our Mission

#### Open Space was designed with stress relief at the forefront of our minds. Open Space is an environment where you can feel free of anxiety, and just take a few minutes to relax from the stresses of daily life. We researched various techniques at reducing stress and implemented as many as we could into our game. The research can be found [here](https://openspacegame.herokuapp.com/title-screen/credits)
